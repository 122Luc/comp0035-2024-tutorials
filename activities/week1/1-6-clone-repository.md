# Activity 6: Create a clone of a repository in your IDE

When you create a repository on GitHub.com, it exists as a **remote** repository. You can edit files
directly on GitHub however this is not recommended as you will miss the benefits of an IDE such as auto-complete, error
checking and code AI.

Instead, you
will [clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)
. This creates a local copy of the repository on your computer. You then need to sync between the two locations.

If you have integrated your IDE and GitHub you should be able to follow the IDE's instructions (links below) and enter
the repository name by entering the owner's github account name and the repository name e.g.

- `ucl-comp0035/comp0035-practice`
- `yourusername/hello-world`

If you have not been able to integrate your IDE with GitHub, you may need to find the URL of the repository instead. In 
GitHub copy the URL for the repository. To do this, open your 'practice' repository, select **Code** and then copy the 
URL to the clipboard.
