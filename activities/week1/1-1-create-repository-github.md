# Activity 1: Create a new repository directly on GitHub

You should learn this method, though you will not use it for the coursework or tutorials.

### Instructions

Instructions are also
available [in the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

1. Login to [GitHub](https://github.com/login)
2. At the top right of the GitHub interface find the **+** button and use the dropdown to select New Repository.
    - Alternative option: Click on the 'Respositories' link in the top menu bar. Then on the 'Repositories' page find
      the green button marked 'New' and select it.
3. Complete the following:
    1. **Repository name**: Type a short, memorable name for your repository, e.g. "hello-world".
    2. **Description (optional)**: Optional, you can add a description of your repository, e.g. "My first repository on
       GitHub."
    3. Select **Private**: Private means only you or anyone you later add as a
       collaborator can see your repository. If you choose Public anyone can see your code. Choosing Private is expected
       for coursework to avoid issues with plagiarism.
    4. Select **Add a README file**
    5. Select **Add .gitignore** and click on the dropdown. In the Filter box start typing Python and you should find it
       and then click on Python.
    6. **Choose a license** is optional. A license tells other developers whether and how they can use your code.
4. Click **Create repository**.
